# RimWorld Together Expansions
The official repository of the [RimWorld Together](https://github.com/Byte-Nova/Rimworld-Together) team, containing every official expanded compatibility with the rest of the game's mods.

## What is an expanded compatibility?
The vast majority of mods will work on RimWorld Together out of the box, but some of them implement functionality that doesn't get synced with the rest of the players. Expansions make it so modders can add that functionality into the mod without much hassle. 

Mods like [SOS2](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1909914131), [Rim War](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2222935097), and the similar, will require expansions to get the full potential out of them!
